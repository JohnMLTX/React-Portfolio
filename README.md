# What I've done

## Dependencies

CodeSandbox.io threw a mountain of errors from react-icons, so a few other dependencies were added:

- bootstrap
- reactstrap

Additionally, webvitals wasn't working on my end at all, no matter what I threw at it, so the main reportWebVitals.js has been commeted out and the dependency removed (just to hide the errors).

## Code

The only file that kept throwing problems when I went to compile and look around was \src\components\Contact\index.js, so almost all of the tweaks I made were made there. It's a bit messy, but it now reports back fully functional, and App.js now loads properly!
